# Principles

## Windows

On **Windows** platform, there is no direct way in nodejs to set wallpaper. The best solution is make use of Windows API, so I provided a binary executable `wallpaper.exe` as well as C++ sources to do this.

## OS X

There are many solutions to change wallpaper on OS X, but some of them are for older versions of the system. On OS X 10.9+, thers is an SQLite database file **(~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db)** which manages the desktop background preferences including the wallpaper.

## Linux

Unfortunately, there are many desktop environment like GNOME, KDE on Linux. So the interfaces are totally different. To make it simple, just call the interfaces one by one until one of them succeed.
